As this was my first experience using D3.js, AI was used fairly liberally in this project.
With that being said, much of the coding was done such that I still had a handle of what changes I was making.
Towards the end, I believe the AI was forgetting bits of the conversation and ultimately left me to find and make the changes.
There were only a select few times where I asked for a complete script rather than just the change,
and even in a case that I did, the AI had altered things and ultimately broke what I was asking for.
Overall, I learned a decent amount from this assignment and am looking forward to Assignment 2.
